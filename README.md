# Telegram-MRE-Example

This is an example of how to create dialogues between users and your Bot in Telegram using Manual Reset Events.
In this example are two Commands: /user and /random.

If you want to test it, you have to copy your Bot Token into the TelegramBot.cs, Line 22.

# /user - Command

The Bot is asking you multiple Questions and sends your input at the end to you again.
This can be used to gather User Informations and save/work with them.

# /random - Command

You send multiple Options to the Bot and it will choose one of them randomly from your input.
